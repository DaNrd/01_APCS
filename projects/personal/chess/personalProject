-- 4 Levels of Complexity --
    Version 1:
        - board with pieces
        - mouse based movement
    Version 2:
        - checks for valid move
        - kill pieces
    Version 3:
        - turn based
        - castle
    Version 4:
        - check for check
        - score
        - animations?
