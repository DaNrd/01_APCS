# Philippe the Cow

When run, this project will use Java's graphics functionality to display a cow named Philippe in a 700px by 400px window.

This project satisfies the requirement of using the existing code for a cow (linked below) and adding on to it to create one's own cow.

### Errors

This cow currently has no errors except for its lack of photorealism.

### Code Overview

The Main.java class creates a new cow instance (based off of CowFrame.java) named Philippe displaying it on the screen. It also makes Philippe visible and tells him to exit when the window is closed.

The CowFrame.java imports the required libraries, and declares a public class "CowFrame". Within CowFrame, two colors are declared. "Bisque" is used for the nose of the cow and "Off White" is used for the cow itself. It then initializes the background, setting the size and default color. Next, it contains the code to paint the sky, clouds, sun and cow.

### Major Challenges

The only major challenges that I encountered were discovering what each value of the draw commands and discovering the fill commands.

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to Quintin for help getting Eclipse up and running and thanks to Josh for support and suggestions regarding the cow.
