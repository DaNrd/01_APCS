	#Classes:
		-
	#Methods:
		-
	depthOfClassHierarchy: (number of levels of subclass)
		-
	lexicalMethodCallDepth: (depth of function methods (method calls method calls method is 2))
		-
	dynamicMethodCallDepth: ("distance traveled on graph" try to find that is diff from lexical but not infinite)
		-
	complexityOfInter-MethodInteraction: (how complex the method calling other method flow is)
		-
	runTime: (how long the program runs)
		-
	rateOfGrowthOfRunTime: (how long the later programs run)
		-
	iterationNestingDepth: (maximum iteration order of growth)
