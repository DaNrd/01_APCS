# US Flag

When run, this project draws a circle that moves according to the given position, velocity, and acceleration for the x, y, and z axis.

### Code Overview

Main.java basically just creates an instance of PhysicsFrame.java and makes it visible.

FlagFrame.java:

	asks for dimension number then pos0, v0 and a0 for x y and z

	calculates the size and position of the circle and updates every 20 milliseconds

### Major Challenges

The biggest challenge for me was time since program start.
