Logic:
  Symbols:
    ~ = not
    & = and
    | = or
    => = if-then
    <=> = bi-conditional

2 fundamentals of language:
  Syntax: "grammar"
    2 Kinds of Logical Sentences
      Simple: 1 proposition constant (can test with java quick reference)
      Compound: more than 1 proposition constant with other factors (other chars or modifiers)
      * If syntactically correct, it is legal.
  Semantics: refers to how we determine the truth value of a sentence
Other Vocabulary:
  Evaluation: determine the truth value of a given logical sentence (pay attention to order of operation)
  Satisfaction: there exists a truth assignment that makes the sentence true
  Types of sentences:
    Unsatisfiable: there is no truth assignments that yields "true"
    Valid: no matter the truth assignment, the sentence yields "true"
    Contingent: there are truth assignments that are "true" or "false" (has both)
  Equivalent: two (or more) logical sentences that when attached with a bi-conditional statement yield a "valid"
  Entailment: two (or more) logical sentences that when attached with a conditional statement yield a "valid" (not always symmetrical f(x)=>g(x) doesn't necessarily mean g(x)=>f(x))
  Consistency: if there exists at least 1 truth assignment where both sentences are "true" (attach 2 logical sentences with a ____ and if it yields ____ the sentences are consistent)

Vocabulary 2
  Exception: an event that interrupts the code flow to help find errors / prevent breaks
  Iterator: an object in java that supports iteration (doing something over and over again)
  Generalization: taking an individual item and generalizing for use in multiple places
  Sine function: computes y coordinate of e^i(x) a complex number
  Tree: a system of organization (used in abstraction) where there is a base class with classes of more complexity branching out
  Pointer: a small number that points to a larger file (less code to transmit over wifi, etc...)
  Complex number: a number that is in terms of i and a constant "a + bi" where i = sqrt(-1)
